<desc>Infantry laser weapons previously existed only in the realms of science fiction. Any laser powerful enough to be a viable combat weapon would need a battery the size of a truck - the word &quot;impractical&quot; being an understatement.&#10;&#10;The arrival of alien technology has changed all of this. The enormous energy content of an Alenium crystal allows a battery no larger than a standard ammunition magazine to generate up to a dozen laser beams, each capable of burning through an inch of steel. Superconducting ceramics can be used to cool the weapon, storing the waste heat from each shot and dissipating slowly enough to avoid injury (provided one is careful where they place their hands). This eliminates the need for bulky refrigeration units, reducing the size and weight of the weapons significantly.  &#10;&#10;In order to minimise adjustment time for our troops, our laser weapons have been designed to operate like conventional firearms and have similar range and accuracy to their predecessors. There are some notable differences, most obviously the improved damage thermal shock weapons inflict upon their targets. Less favourably, a laser weapon will have roughly half the ammunition capacity of a ballistic weapon. In order to streamline this process, we have designed a single standardised battery for all of our laser weapons. The design is not complex; a cylindrical steel jacket that contains an Alenium crystal and locks into the weapon with a simple twist. These power cells are trivial to manufacture compared to the weapons themselves, so are available in effectively unlimited quantities.&#10;&#10;Be aware that manufacturing these weapons consumes a large amount of alien alloys and is both expensive and time consuming - but I still believe they represent a good investment despite this. At the very least, some new toys may raise morale amongst your men.</desc>
<cdesc>步兵激光武器本来只存在于科幻作品之中。任何威力足以投入实战的激光武器都需要一个卡车那么大的电池供电--说它&quot;不切实际&quot;都说的太轻了。&#10;&#10;然而外星科技的出现改变这一切。Alenium 水晶蕴含的无穷能量让一个寻常弹夹大小的电池就足以发射一打激光束 ，每发都足以烧穿一英寸厚的钢板。超导陶瓷被用于冷却武器，储存每次射击造成的热量，并缓慢的散出以避免出现烫伤（假设使用者把手小心的放在了正确的位置上）。这使得我们再也不需要厚重的冷却系统，显著的减少了武器的大小和重量。 &#10;&#10;为了尽可能的减少我们士兵的适应时间，我们的激光武器被设计的跟传统的枪械没有什么区别，射程和精度都跟这些前辈差不多。一个不那么好的消息是激光武器只有差不多实弹武器一般的弹药。为了缓解这个问题，我们设计了一款通用电池可以适用于所有我们的激光武器。设计并不复杂;一个圆柱状的金属壳里面装着一个Alenium水晶，轻轻一扭就可以安装到武器上。这种能量核心的生产难度跟武器本身相比一个天上一个地下，所以我们可以无限制的提供&#10;&#10;要注意的是生产这种武器需要消耗大量的外星合金，而且非常昂贵和耗时 - 但尽管如此我还是认为这是一个极好的投资。即使退一万步说，一些新的玩具起码能让你的士兵士气一振</cdesc>
